### 📚 Library Management System – Django Mini Project

This is my first Django mini project, built to understand the fundamentals of Django and web application development. The goal of this project was to learn how CRUD operations work and how a Django project is structured from scratch.

The application allows basic management of a library system, where books and records can be added, viewed, updated, and deleted through a clean web interface.

#### ✨ Features

* Add new books to the library
* View all available books
* Update book details
* Delete books
* Simple and clean UI using HTML & CSS
* Django-powered backend with models, views, templates, and URLs

#### 🎯 What I Learned

* Django project & app structure
* Creating models and running migrations
* Implementing CRUD operations
* Working with views and templates
* Handling forms and user input
* Connecting frontend pages with backend logic
* Basic routing using `urls.py`

This project helped me build a strong foundation in Django and prepared me for larger projects like my **LocalServe – Local Service Booking Web App**.

It is a beginner-friendly project and a great starting point for anyone learning Django.
